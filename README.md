# BongoCodeTest
This is a simple project to automate the BongoBD website for load and play a free video.
At first download the Folder BongoBDtest
You will see a folder named TestFiles
In the that folder you will find the file Automatedwebsite.py
You can execute the .py file and see the automated website.
Or you can open it with PyCharm or any other Python supported IDE and run that to see the automated website
According to my code, it will first go to your website www.BongoBD.com
Then it will search free videos in the search bar
Then after reaching the free videos list, it will load and play the second free video
